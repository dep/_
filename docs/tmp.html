<p>A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 data-heading="Recommendation" id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
<p>Camille Fournier, the managing director and head of platform engineering at Two Sigma, and a former tech vice president at Goldman Sachs and CTO at Rent the Runway, explains how quality management drives sound engineering, workplace harmony and future profits. She refutes the widely held idea among software engineers that management is a “soft” skill that requires less willpower than engineering. Fournier’s real-life anecdotes and examples illustrate her argument that good management matters in every field. She offers interesting surprises and calm guidance for software engineers looking to move into management and for those promoted into management against their better judgment. <em>getAbstract</em> recommends her insights as a useful career guide for engineering tech leads and, in particular, software engineering managers.</p>
<h2 data-heading="Take-Aways" id="take-aways">Take-Aways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many software engineers don’t like managing and prefer to write code.</li>
<li>Besides relying on technical skills, software engineering managers must devote time to learning new skills, including how to direct people and projects.</li>
<li>Good managers establish what they expect from the people they lead and make sure their teams deliver according to spec and on time.</li>
<li>Engineering managers need strong technical skills to establish credibility with their staff.</li>
<li>To manage others well, first manage yourself.</li>
<li>The first supervisory job for most software engineers is tech lead. </li>
<li>How you manage your engineers influences how they manage others.</li>
<li>Mentoring employees helps the coach and employee. If you mentor interns, you can gain fresh perspectives.</li>
<li>Engineering managers should conduct one-on-one, “skip-level” meetings with their staff.</li>
<li>They should develop 30-, 60- and 90-day plans for all new hires.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-heading="Summary" id="summary">Summary</h2>
<h3 data-heading="**Technologists**" id="technologists"><strong>Technologists</strong></h3>
<p>Software engineering managers are first, last and always technologists – professionals who rely on logic, analysis and programming expertise as the building blocks of their careers. These engineers operate with a special mind-set and singular technical skills. They are objective and willing to try new approaches if the old ways don’t work. Engineering managers are also change agents and, often, significant assets to their companies.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The tech industry is filled with people who despise management, thinking it’s not as important a job as writing code.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, many software engineers and engineering managers don’t respect the management function or what it involves. Some “brilliant, introverted” engineers don’t want to manage. They want to write code, not think about the political angles and ramifications inherent to leadership positions. No organization can survive without professional management, including technological organizations that develop software as their basic business pursuit. They need managers who are deeply informed about their work and who build up good management skills.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**Career Paths**" id="career-paths"><strong>Career Paths</strong></h3>
<p>A common career path for software engineers is to start as a technical lead and then become an engineering manager. Ultimately, the engineering manager would advance to serve in a senior technical position, such as engineering director or head of engineering, chief technical officer (CTO), chief information officer (CIO), chief scientist, chief architect, chief product officer, vice president of engineering, or vice president of technical operations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But management is a job, it is a necessary and important job, and in particular, it’s your job right now.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter their career path or ultimate targeted position, engineers should learn to be effective managers. Engineering supervisors need to know how to manage groups of expert technicians who expect their managers to have hands-on expertise. Such knowledge grants engineering managers the credibility they need to direct other engineers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As a manager you help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a manager, you can’t ever ignore the engineers on your team. If they need your attention, give it to them. But don’t micromanage. Every engineer hates that kind of manager.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**Management Responsibilities**" id="management-responsibilities"><strong>Management Responsibilities</strong></h3>
<p>An engineering manager has numerous duties. Most important, you must help your staff members focus on the right activities, and help them grow professionally and develop their careers. This includes lining up training courses for them and assisting them in developing the “promotion packet” presentations they will need to advance in their careers within the firm and earn raises. Help your staff members establish their work-related goals. Conduct regular, one-on-one meetings with the software engineers who work for you, usually every week. Prepare agendas for your meetings, and use them to learn what’s happening with your team members and their projects. Listen carefully to what they tell you. Provide the individual feedback they need.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**Mentoring**" id="mentoring"><strong>Mentoring</strong></h3>
<p>A vital part of management is serving as a mentor to the engineers you supervise. This is particularly important for new hire and interns. Your job as a mentor is to guide your subordinates and provide them with useful direction and advice. You shouldn’t waste their time or “intimidate and belittle them.” Get interns involved in the action in your company right away. Check in with them periodically during the day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Breaking down a project has a lot of similarity to…designing systems, and learning this skill is valuable even for engineers who don’t want to manage people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mentoring new hires can be immensely beneficial. Your new hires serve as fresh eyes that will help you see your company and its product line in a new light. Make sure you have adequate “onboarding documents” to help new employs segue easily into their work environment. These “step-by-step guides” should show them how to set “up their development environments,” teach them how your “tracking systems” work and educate them about the tools they’ll be using.   </p>
<h3 data-heading="**The Tech Lead Position**" id="the-tech-lead-position"><strong>The Tech Lead Position</strong></h3>
<p>The first semi-supervisory role many software engineers advance into is tech lead. This is a position of leadership, although tech leads don’t manage other people. Tech lead isn’t a formal rung on the career ladder, but rather a set of additional responsibilities. The tech lead must “influence without authority.” In his book <em>Talking with Tech Leads</em>, Patrick Kua describes typical tech leads as being “responsible for a (software) development team,” and writing code with their teams for at least 30% of their time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Very rarely is the tech lead given an increase in salary or a title bump, and first-time tech leads often have no idea how hard the new responsibilities can be.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tech leads must be competent technical professionals who know the architecture they support. While tech leads usually continue to write code, they have the extra responsibility of representing their group’s interests and activities to senior management, handling various project management details, and vetting the team’s plans for future work and product delivery. The tech lead’s biggest responsibility is to ensure that the team’s projects keep moving ahead. The tech lead must balance spending time writing code with spending time meeting the team’s critical management needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Plenty of great engineers make ineffective managers because they don’t know or want to deal with the politics of leadership in their companies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An engineer tech lead is in an ideal position to learn how to become a technical project manager. Tech leads, who can make independent decisions on behalf of their teams, want their team members to be more productive. Tech leads coordinate with “product, analytics and other areas of the business” and figure out which new software will meet the firm’s business goals. Technical leads also seek solutions for issues that impede their group’s progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you…make all of the technical decisions without soliciting the input of your team, they’ll resent you and blame you when things go wrong.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When upper level executives must designate a tech lead, they may select the engineer who’s willing to spend time handling management tasks, sometimes even over more experienced engineers who aren’t as interested in having management responsibilities.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**Managing People and Teams**" id="managing-people-and-teams"><strong>Managing People and Teams</strong></h3>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve just become your firm’s newest engineering manager. Although you occupy an entry-level position that lacks seniority, you are formally in charge of managing engineers. Your primary management duties include conducting routine one-on-one interviews and providing “feedback on career growth, progression toward goals, areas for improvement and praise as warranted.” You’ll help staff members develop through stretch assignments, training and mentoring as you add new people to the team and fulfill various management responsibilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hands-on expertise is what gives you credibility and what helps you make decisions and lead your team effectively.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you work with new hires as their engineering manager, develop 30-, 60- and 90-day plans for them. Their typical tasks will include code familiarization, bug fixes and new releases. Ask new hires to edit onboarding documents “to reflect processes or tools that have changed since the last hire” or to fix content that seems confusing. New hires can give you an independent take on your firm, your team and your software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Developing basic standards as a team helps everyone communicate…in code and design reviews, and it depersonalizes the process of providing technical feedback.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New managers must become effective delegators. Explain to team members what their individual goals should be, and lay out their specific responsibilities. Provide them with the necessary support and guidance. Then get out of their way, and let them work.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**The Engineering Lead**" id="the-engineering-lead"><strong>The Engineering Lead</strong></h3>
<p>The engineering lead manages the team and makes sure technical details, such as bug fixes, get attention. The engineering lead also stays abreast of code development to eliminate any “bottlenecks and process problems.” He or she ensures that the team stays focused and coordinates with the “product lead to manage project scope.” The lead also guarantees tech deliverables on time and according to spec.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly, that you catch every detail beforehand or that you predict the future; it’s that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The engineering lead makes sure the team stays functional. Teams become dysfunctional when they miss deadlines. If this happens, the engineering lead will need to jump back into the process and write extra code so the team can stay on track. If team members become unhappy due to overwork, the engineering lead may need to “slow down the product road map” temporarily to help the team regain stability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The best mentoring relationships evolve naturally and in the context of larger work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When team members are under pressure, they may not collaborate effectively. The engineering lead should promote activities that give team members opportunities to socialize together away from work.</p>
<p>Engineer leads must help their team members understand and focus on their primary goals. The team should set aside 20% of its time for “generic sustaining engineering work,” for example, “testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions,” and so on.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**The Engineering Director**" id="the-engineering-director"><strong>The Engineering Director</strong></h3>
<p>Managing an engineering team can be a challenge; managing multiple teams is even more difficult. Usually, this is a job for the engineering director. This professional is responsible for the organization’s technical competence and capabilities. He or she works beyond the day-to-day obligation to write code. The engineering director should research the latest technologies and current developments in the field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Practicing the art of teaching can help us learn how to nurture and coach, how to phrase things so that others will listen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The director is also responsible for maintaining “development/infrastructure standards and processes to create technology that will deliver sustained value to the business.” However, an engineering director also should set aside at least half a day each week to do something creative, such as “participate in an open source project.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The secret of managing is keeping the people who hate you away from the ones who haven’t made up their minds.” (Major League Baseball manager Casey Stengel, 1890–1975)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The engineering director is a role model for “cross-functional collaboration” within the organization. To manage multiple teams, the engineering director first must manage his or her own time. Managing multiple teams comes down to intelligent decision making and wise delegation. This means paying attention to the promising engineers on your team and helping them assume new leadership roles. The engineering director always makes sure each team’s “process of writing, releasing and supporting code” goes smoothly.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**Managing Engineering Managers**" id="managing-engineering-managers"><strong>Managing Engineering Managers</strong></h3>
<p>Managing software engineering managers is akin to managing multiple software engineering teams. Your managers will need coaching and mentoring. Evaluate the performance of each manager based on his or her team’s results. Hold your managers responsible for those results.</p>
<p>“Meet with people who report to people who report to you.” Use these “skip-level meetings” to influence engineers on the teams that your subordinate managers guide. Engage in skip-level meetings by getting together once each quarter with each person on every team.  </p>
<h3 data-heading="**Senior Management**" id="senior-management"><strong>Senior Management</strong></h3>
<p>Senior engineering managers are leaders. The company’s top executives will expect senior engineering managers to make decisions based on limited information, manage office politics and plan ahead for a rewarding future for the company. Expect to play a prominent role in setting the firm’s future technical direction.  </p>
<p>As a senior engineering leader, you’ll be partially responsible for shaping your corporation’s culture. Business author Frederic Laloux defines “culture” as “how things get done, without people having to think about it.” Culture encompasses your organization’s rules of the road. Smart engineering leaders reward employees for their work and for exemplifying the firm’s core values. Underscore these values when you interview job applicants.</p>
<h3 data-heading="**Stay Curious**" id="stay-curious"><strong>Stay Curious</strong></h3>
<p>Moving from “mentor to manager to senior leader” can be a tough path. The more you understand yourself, the easier your journey will be. This requires self-reflection. Meditation can help. Accept that you won’t always be right. “Be willing to have your notions proven wrong.” Maintain your sense of curiosity. Ask plenty of questions. In engineering management, as in life, you will never go wrong if you look “for the other side of the story.”                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>
